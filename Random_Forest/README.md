# Diabetes Predictor using Random Forest Algorithm

## Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes using a Random Forest algorithm. The dataset used is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database. The Random Forest classifier is trained on the dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes based on several medical attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database. It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). The predictor variables include:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

The target variable (Outcome) indicates whether a person has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## You can install the required libraries using pip:

- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

- git clone <repository-url>
- cd <project-directory>
- python Diabetes_Predictor_Using_Random_Forest.py

### Implementation Details
The project is implemented in Python, and the key steps are:

1. Load the dataset: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. Display dataset information: Column names, the first five records, and the dataset's dimensions are displayed.
3. Split the data: The data is split into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Random Forest model: A Random Forest classifier is initialized and trained on the training data.
5. Evaluate the model: The model's accuracy on the training and test sets is printed.
6. Plot feature importance: A bar plot showing the importance of each feature is generated and saved.
