# Diabetes Predictor using Decision Tree Algorithm

This project demonstrates how to create a Diabetes Predictor using the Decision Tree algorithm in Python. The script loads a diabetes dataset, trains a Decision Tree classifier, evaluates its performance, and visualizes feature importances.

## Introduction

This project was created by Mahesh Pawar and uses the Decision Tree algorithm to predict the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is available in the `diabetes.csv` file.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-predictor-decision-tree.git
   cd diabetes-predictor-decision-tree

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of several medical 
predictor variables and one target variable, `Outcome`, which indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## Results
The script prints the accuracy of the Decision Tree model on both the training and test sets for different values of the regularization 
parameter C.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Decision Tree Algorithm model to predict diabetes based on medical data. The model can be 
further improved by exploring different preprocessing techniques, feature selection methods, and more advanced machine learning algorithms.
