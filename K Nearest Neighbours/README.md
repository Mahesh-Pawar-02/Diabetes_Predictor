# Diabetes Predictor using K Nearest Neighbours

This project implements a Diabetes Predictor using the K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on several medical attributes.

## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management can significantly improve the quality of life for patients. This project uses a machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes using the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which is available on Kaggle. It consists of 8 medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome).

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## You can install the required libraries using pip:

- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

- git clone <repository-url>
- cd <project-directory>
- python Diabetes_Predictor_Using_KNN.py

## Script Overview
The script performs the following steps:

Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
Displays basic information about the dataset.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains multiple KNN models with different numbers of neighbors.
Plots the training and test accuracy for different numbers of neighbors.
Evaluates the best model and prints the accuracy on the training and test sets.

## Results
The script will output the accuracy of the KNN classifier on both the training and test sets. It will also plot the training and test accuracy for different values of k (number of neighbors).
